CMPT 740 Assignment 1: Storage
- Lynus Vaz, Mayanka Medhe

1. Testing Environment
	• CPU model: AMD A8-7410 APU with AMD Radeon R5 Graphics
	• Memory size: 6.8G
	• Type of storage device: hard disk
2. Methodology
	To evaluate the performance we used clock gettime with CLOCK REALTIME flag which gives us results
	with nanoseconds precision. For random read, we generated 1000 random page ids and slot ids using rand()
	function making sure both page id and slot id were valid and combined them to get the RID. For sequential
	reads, we generated the starting RID in a similar manner and read the next 100 records. For deletion, we
	tested both runs on random RIDs. We generated RIDs in the same way as mentioned above. The value of
	the record is a string set in a sequential manner starting from 0. We used direct file read and write 
	(using O_DIRECT) in order to bypass the OS buffer cache. Also, we are writing the page to disk when it is filled.
3. Result
	3.1 Sequential Read
		Page size: 4KB
		Record size: 8 bytes
		Scan length: 100
		Delete: 100
		In sequential read test case, insertion of 10000000 took 2676 sec 975366592 nsec. The total time taken
		to read 100 records is 0 sec 20827700 nsec and to delete 100 is 7 sec 30753548 nsec. Therefore, the average
		insert is 3735 records/sec average sequential read is 4801 records/sec and average delete is 14 records/sec.
	3.2 Random Read
		Page size: 16KB
		Record size: 64 bytes
		Scan length: 1000
		Delete: 50
		In random read test case, insertion of 10000000 took 2728 sec 719789491 nsec. The total time taken to read 1000 records
		is 9 sec 537496684 nsec and to delete 50 is 3 sec 291913823 nsec. Therefore, the average insert is 3664, average random read is 104 records/sec and average delete is 15 records/sec.
